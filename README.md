- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno.
- 👀 I’m interested in C, Rust and Python programming. Running, biking and gardening are also center of interests, but not quite what Github can help with :-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, and dusting off my C programming. It's been 30+ years since I learned C, and did not use it for 25+ years, a few things have changed, and my coding with pointers got rusty!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects. So far, I did not find any project of interest where I have the required level to contribute though.  
- 📫 I'm reachable at bru65pag@gmail.com.
