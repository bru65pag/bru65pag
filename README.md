- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming. Running and gardening are also center of interests, but not quite what Github can help with :-)
- I also have interest in ZX81. It was my first computer. 40 years ago, I was totally incapable of programming the Z80 processor in machine langage; so I decided to give it a try a few years ago.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects. So far, I did not find any project of interest where I have the required level to contribute though.  
- 📫 I'm reachable at bru65pag@gmail.com.
